# go2run
Using Go to run (manage) your network devices.

Work in Progress.....

The goal with this repository is to build a tool set that empowers the user to manage their network devices to the degree they see fit.
I view this respository as an evolution of my Go_Network_Scripts repo. One difference is the use of go modules for package management.

Phase 1 - Use Go to programatically interface with remote device Cli.

Using Go to automate CLI operations via SSH

- Interactive script that will prompt you for hosts and commands (config/show) - prompted_ssh/
- Configuation / validation commands script- ssh_client/
- Copying files to remote host - scp_client/


Will update as time permits.
