# go2run - Using Go to run (manage) your network devices.

Work in Progress.....

The goal with this repository is to build a toolset that allows the user to manage their network devices to the degree they see fit.
I view this respository as an evolution of my Go_Network_Scripts repo. One difference is the use of go modules for package management.

Phase 1 - Use Go to programatically interface with remote device Cli.

Using Go to automate CLI operations via SSH

- runcli/ -  This package will prompt you for hosts and commands (config/show) to run on your devices
- ssh_client - (Work in Progress) Configuation / validation script uses a hostfile and seperate configuration files to configure hosts
- scp_client - (Work in Progress) Copying files to remote host


Will update as time permits.
