# go2run
Using Go to manage network devices.

Work in Progress.....

The goal with this repository is to build an extensible tool set that empowers the user to manage their network to the degree they see fit.
I view this respository as an evolution of my Go_Network_Scripts repo. One difference is the use of go modules for package management.

Phase 1 - Use Go to programatically interface with remote device Cli.

Automated CLI operations via SSH
- show commands
- config commands
- Copying files to remote host - scp_client

Will update as time permits.
